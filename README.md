# **Car Space Renting Management System**

## **Project Description**
The **Car Space Renting Management System** is a web-based platform that facilitates the renting and booking of car spaces. In densely populated urban areas where parking is scarce, this system allows providers to list their unused car spaces and make them available to consumers for booking. The platform serves three types of users: **admin**, **provider**, and **consumer**. Admins manage the platform, providers can register their car spaces, and consumers can book available car spaces based on their needs.
